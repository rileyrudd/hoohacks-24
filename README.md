# TalkMoney LLM for Hoohacks Hackathon 2024

Welcome to TalkMoney LLM, our submission for HooHacks 2024!

## About
Our bank's website features an innovative tool, TalkMoney, which is an AI LLM chat intended to promote personal financial literacy by allowing consumers to ask questions related to their own transactions. 

## Motivation
Financial illiteracy poses a significant challenge in the United States, particularly affecting minority groups within lower socioeconomic brackets. By providing consumers with access to education tailored to their daily transactions and goals, our aim is to foster better financial decision-making and enhance financial literacy over time. Given that personal finance profoundly influences everyone's daily lives, we believe our project has a significant impact.

## Feasibility
While this project was done for a hack-a-thon submission, we believe this technology could be applied by banking services for a few reasons. 1 - consumers already have a trusting relationship with their bank and data collection/usage, no need to ask consumers to trust a new company. 2 - many banking services have taken steps to promote financial literacy, for example offering one on one appointments for financial advice. This technology takes it a step further by allowing many people access.
